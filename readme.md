Asciidoc-table-plugin
===

An asciidoc inspired table plugin for Markdown-it.

With this plugin, you can easily add tables to your markdown content.

The tables support mutli-line contents, and the cells wrap around to the next column
(without you having to manually put them there).

The cell contents can be any valid markup, and they will be rendered accordingly.
